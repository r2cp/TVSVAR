The codes for the assignment are based on the replication codes by Del Negro and Primiceri (2015). In particular, there are four branches: 

- `main`: Contains the original replication codes to generate figures 1-4 of the corrigendum. It corresponds to part (a) of the assignment. 
- `extending-sample`: It contains modifications to the replication codes that extend the sample through 2019Q4 and modify the graphs' limits. It corresponds to part (b) of the assignment.
- `extending-sample-constant-volatilities`: It contains modifications that extend the sample through 2019Q4 and obtain results with the assumption of constant volatilities. 
- `original-sample-constant-volatility`: It contains modifications made to the original replication codes to obtain figures 1-4 using the original sample under the assumption of constant volatilities. It is part (c) of the assignment.
